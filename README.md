## Install

Install using npm:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-email-remove-unused-css
```

## Example

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var remove = require('gulp-email-remove-unused-css');

gulp.task('default', function () {
  return gulp.src('site.css')
    .pipe(remove({
      whitelist: ['.ExternalClass', '.ReadMsgBody', '.yshortcuts', '.Mso*', '.maxwidth-apple-mail-fix', '#outlook', '.module-*']
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./out'));
});
```

### Options

Since the main purpose of this library is to clean **email** HTML, it needs to cater for email code specifics. One of them is that CSS styles will contain fix or hack styles, meant for email software. For example, here are few of them:

```html
#outlook a { padding:0; }
.ExternalClass, .ReadMsgBody { width:100%; }
.ExternalClass, .ExternalClass div, .ExternalClass font, .ExternalClass p, .ExternalClass span, .ExternalClass td { line-height:100%; }
```

Obviously, you will not be using the above classes and id's in the `<body>` of your HTML code, what means they would get removed â€” they are present in `<head>` only. To avoid that, pass the classes and id's in the _whitelist_ key's value, as an array, for example:

```js
.pipe(remove({
  whitelist: ['.ExternalClass', '.ReadMsgBody', '.yshortcuts', '.Mso*', '.maxwidth-apple-mail-fix', '#outlook']
}))
```

You can also use a _glob_, for example in order to whitelist classes `module-1`, `module-2` ... `module-99`, `module-100`, you can simply whitelist them as `module-*`:

```js
.pipe(remove({
  whitelist: ['.ExternalClass', '.ReadMsgBody', '.yshortcuts', '.Mso*', '.maxwidth-apple-mail-fix', '#outlook', '.module-*']
}))
// => all class names that begin with ".module-" will not be touched by this library.
```

## Regarding removing unused CSS from web pages & competition

This library is meant to be used on any HTML where there are **no external stylesheets** and there are no JavaScript which could add or remove classes or id's dynamically. It's quite rare to find a **web page** that would be like that, but it's the case for all **email newsletters** and this library is aimed at cleaning email HTML code. If your website's HTML is like that, this library will work perfectly fine on it as well. Email HTML and website HTML are both the same markup language.

If you need more advanced CSS removal tools, check out [uncss](https://github.com/giakki/uncss) and [gulp-uncss](https://github.com/ben-eb/gulp-uncss) which runs a headless browser and is capable to parse external stylesheets. However, it's by magnitude slower and it's definitely an overkill for email HTML code.

There's also more direct competitor, [postcss-remove-unused](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-remove-unused) which uses Cheerio, but:

1) `postcss-remove-unused` is tied with PostCSS and can't be used outside of it. Its _testing_ is also tied to PostCSS and dependent on it. On other hand, this library is only a Gulp wrapper for [email-remove-unused-css](https://github.com/code-and-send/email-remove-unused-css) which is tool-independent (reads `string`, outputs `string`). I'm a strong believer that core functionality should be decoupled from the wrappers, PostHTML, PostCSS, Gulp, Grunt, font-end interfaces or anything else. In the past I decoupled [Detergent's core](https://github.com/code-and-send/detergent) from its [front-end](https://detergent.io).
2) [postcss-remove-unused](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-remove-unused) doesn't remove `id`'s, while [email-remove-unused-css](https://github.com/code-and-send/email-remove-unused-css) does and works for **both id's and classes** (and a mix of both)! Mind you, some of email hacks are based on id's, for example, `#outlook a {padding: 0; }` which causes "View in browser" toolbar menu link to appear on Outlook 2010. Style cleaning library must recognise id's in order to white-list them. This library does!
